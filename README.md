\# ⚙️ EVWarranty System



\## 🧭 Overview

\*\*EVWarranty System\*\* is a distributed \*\*Microservices-based platform\*\* for managing vehicle information, parts catalog, and warranty workflows.  

The system is designed to ensure scalability, flexibility, and fault isolation using \*\*YARP API Gateway\*\* and \*\*RabbitMQ (MassTransit)\*\* for asynchronous communication between services.

\## 🏗️ System Architecture



\### 🧩 Microservices Style

\- Each domain (User, Vehicle, Part Catalog, Warranty) is implemented as an independent microservice.

\- \*\*API Gateway (YARP)\*\* handles centralized routing, authentication, and request aggregation.

\- \*\*Message Broker (RabbitMQ + MassTransit)\*\* enables asynchronous communication for background jobs and inter-service messaging.

\- Designed for \*\*fault tolerance\*\*, \*\*independent scalability\*\*, and \*\*future extensibility\*\*.



\### 🧠 Core Components

| Component | Description |

|------------|-------------|

| \*\*YARP API Gateway\*\* | Routes client requests to appropriate microservices. |

| \*\*User Service\*\* | Manages authentication, roles, and user profiles. |

| \*\*Vehicle Service\*\* | Handles vehicle registration, ownership, and service history. |

| \*\*Part Catalog Service\*\* | Manages parts, packages, categories, and warranty policies. |

| \*\*Warranty Service\*\* | Handles warranty claims, validations, and service center actions. |

| \*\*RabbitMQ + MassTransit\*\* | Provides message-based communication between services. |

| \*\*Database\*\* | Each service has its own schema (isolated per domain). |

\## 🔄 Business Flows



\### 🅰️ a) Warranty Flow

1\. Customer submits a \*\*warranty claim\*\* through the system.  

2\. The \*\*Warranty Service\*\* validates the claim (checks warranty policy, vehicle data, and parts).  

3\. \*\*Vehicle Service\*\* confirms ownership and mileage.  

4\. \*\*Part Catalog Service\*\* verifies the part/package warranty policy.  

5\. Once approved, a \*\*Service Request\*\* is generated and processed asynchronously via RabbitMQ.  

6\. Customer receives claim status updates through the \*\*API Gateway\*\*.

\### 🅱️ b) Service Flow

1\. Service center receives a \*\*maintenance/service request\*\*.  

2\. \*\*Vehicle Service\*\* provides vehicle details and history.  

3\. \*\*Part Catalog Service\*\* suggests compatible parts/packages.  

4\. The \*\*Warranty Service\*\* validates if parts are under warranty.  

5\. Service report is generated and stored, with messages sent to RabbitMQ for notification and analytics updates.

\### 🆎 c) Recall / Service Campaign Flow

1\. Manufacturer issues a \*\*recall campaign\*\* for specific models or parts.  

2\. \*\*Part Catalog Service\*\* identifies affected parts and packages.  

3\. \*\*Vehicle Service\*\* locates vehicles that match recall conditions.  

4\. Notifications are sent to \*\*owners via User Service\*\* and \*\*service centers\*\*.  

5\. \*\*Warranty Service\*\* logs recall activities and tracks completion status asynchronously.

\## 🗂️ Service Databases



Each microservice has an independent database.
